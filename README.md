## Description

This project uses the power of node.js to generate a portfolio page for a user based on a series of simple prompts. The page will display the user's name, their location, a bio section, a list of their github repositories along with links to each, aswell as a list of contact links that will allow visitors to write them an email and checkout their linkedIn and GitHub profiles.
